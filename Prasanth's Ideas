This is the text file for Prasanth's Ideas

Simple Ones : Bicolor-ish

Point 1-> How to determine darker areas -  Examples include using `image filters` which blur the image horizontally and look 
for darker areas (because the blur causes the text to be highlighted).

Point 2-> How to remove color. Group the pixels together by amount. If the captcha text is in a single color, convert them into black
as well as nearby colors (if its red, anything in the range of 200). The rest (noise or background) convert into white.

REGULAR CAPTCHAS have the background color the most obvious. So take the next color for your text.

A CAPTCHA scheme is considered broken if an algorithm is able to reach a precision of at least one percent. 

Humans take 10 seconds to at least evaluate the captchaa

Conversely, efforts to create CAPTCHA-crushing programs by a team of Stanford researchers resulted in only a 25 percent success rate.


Recaptchas are all based on real words.
